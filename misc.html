        <p>These statistics did not group as easily as those on other pages but are still extremely valuable in assessing the 
          non-scoring strengths of a team. Also included are two previously developed rating systems that attempt to quantify 
          offensive strength and total team strength.

        <p class="graph-caption"><strong>Assist Percentage</strong> describes the percentage of made field goals that came off an assist. To me 
        this reflects the flow of a team's offense. Offenses that are working better and are creating good shot attempts should 
        have more assists. However, the teams in the top 25% for assist percentage only win 2% more of their games on average, based 
        on 2020-2021 regular season data.</p>

        <p class="graph-caption"><strong>Block percentage</strong> represents the percentage of defensive possessions that end in a block, though 
        it does not account for who gained possession after the block. A block also creates a rebound opportunity, meaning that 
        if a player grabs the ball out of the air on a shot attempt, they are credited with both a block and a defensive rebound.</p>

        <p class="graph-caption"><strong>Steal Percentage</strong> calculates the percentage of defensive possessions that ended in a steal. This is 
        the second defensive measure, with block percentage, that clearly calcualtes a defense's impact on the game. Steals frequently 
        result in advantageous offensive possessions, allowing good defense to directly result in good offense.</p>

        <p class="graph-caption"><strong>Simple Rating System</strong> is metric used in multiple sports that uses average point differential and 
        opponent strength to calcualte how strong a team is, with an average of zero and both positive and negative values 
        as possible outcomes.</p>

        <p class="graph-caption"><strong>Offensive Rating</strong> is a metric created by Dean Oliver in 2004 that attempts to describe the number 
        of points a team would be expected to generate in 100 possessions. For reference, Gonzaga leads the nation in offensive 
        rating at 122.4 and they just completed an undefeated 2020-2021 regular season. Furthermore, the top 42 teams in offensive 
        rating have all won at least half of their games. However, one drawback of this statistic is that the top end is typically 
        dominated by strong offenses in weak conferences and is not necessarily useful in predicting postseason success.</p>

        <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobdv/web-ncaa/main/analysis/results/TOV%25_vs_W%25.png'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobdv/web-ncaa/main/analysis/results/TOV%25_vs_W%25.png'></a>
        <p class="graph-caption"><strong>Turnover Percentage</strong> is the only significantly negative correlation described here and it makes sense.
        Giving your opponent the ball robs you of a possession and gives them an extra one. Teams that fail to protect the ball 
        are rarely as successful as those that hold onto the ball, although a strong shooting performance can help overcome turnover 
        mishaps.</p>
