        <p class="normal-text">I have loved sports statistics for as long as I can remember and have always made brackets for March Madness. Around five years ago, I started using Excel spreadsheets to try and calculate overall team strength to give some insight into picks. This is around the time that advanced sports statistics were becoming 'popular' with sports analysts. Over the last five years, I have created three different algorithms with varying levels of success; my first year had me hooked when I picked 29 out of the first 32 games correctly but I haven't been near that since.</p>
