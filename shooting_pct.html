        <h3>Shooting Percentages</h3>
        <p>The ability to put the ball in the basket is, understandably, the most important statistic in basketball. No matter 
          what else a team does in a game, the most points wins. This leads to many measures of shooting percentage to describe 
          a team's skill.

        <img src='analysis/results/FT%_vs_W%.png'>
        <p><strong>Free Throw Percentage</strong> measures only free throws, the only undefended play in basketball. Typically, 
        you would expect that the teams that best take advantage of these 'free' points would win the highest percentage of their 
        games, but that isn't always the case. Additionally, it is valuable to pair this measure with free throw attempt rate (on 
        the 'Pace' page) to more accurately picture a team's free throw situation.</p>

        <img src='analysis/results/FG%_vs_W%.png'>
        <p><strong>Field Goal Percentage</strong> describes the success rate at which a team makes all shots except free throws. This 
        is a statistic that equally counts two point attempts and three point attempts. This is a good, though basic, statistic for 
        describing a team's ability to shoot the basketball, score points, and therefore win games.</p>

      <div class='col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6'>
        <img src='analysis/results/2P%_vs_W%.png'>
        <p><strong>Two Point Percentage</strong> is nearly identical to field goal percentage but only accounts for shots taken inside 
        the three point arc. This percentage should be higher than both field goal percentage and three point percentage as it is describing 
        the 'easier' shots.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6'>
        <img src='analysis/results/3P%_vs_W%.png'>
        <p><strong>Three Point Percentage</strong>, much like two point percentage, is a subset of field goal percentage. In this case, 
        it measures all shots taken from beyond the three point line. Note that this would even include full court desperation shots. 
        Converse to two point percentage, this is typically lower than both field goal percentage and two point percentage because of the shot 
        distance and difficulty.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6'>
        <img src='analysis/results/eFG%_vs_W%.png'>
        <p><strong>Effective Field Goal Percentage</strong> is our first 'advanced' shooting statistic. Much like field goal percentage, 
        this statistic accounts for all non free throws, but does not weight two pointers and three pointers equally. It is calculated by 
        the formula: <em>eFG% = (FGM + 0.5 * 3PM) / FGA</em>. Theoretically, this equation gives an offense credit for the increased 
        value of the three point shot in their field goal percentage. Effective field goal percentage will never be lower than field goal 
        percentage.</p>

      <div class='col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6'>
        <img src='analysis/results/TS%_vs_W%.png'>
        <p><strong>True Shooting Percentage</strong> is perhaps the best measure of scoring efficacy, represented by the equation: 
        <em>TS% = PTS / (2 * (FGA + 0.44 * FTA))</em>. This accounts for all scoring oppurtunities in an attempt to describe scoring 
        efficiency. True shooting percentage should be a similar, though slightly higher, number than eFG% because of the inclusion of 
        free throws. It also wins the prize for the highest correlation with win percentage of any single statistic.</p>
